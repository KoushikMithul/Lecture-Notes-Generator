# Lecture Notes: Expn - tree

Okay, so I need to come up with a concise but descriptive title for this lecture based on the transcript and slide content. Let me start by reading through the provided information carefully.

The lecture is titled "Expn - tree" which I think stands for "Expression Tree." Looking at the transcript, the speaker talks about creating and evaluating expression trees using objects. They mention using a postfix expression to build a binary expression tree. The nodes in this tree have a character as the information field and pointers to left and right children. The slides also discuss the construction of expression trees, specifically using postfix expressions, and how each operand becomes a leaf node while operators become internal nodes.

So, the main subject area here is about expression trees, particularly focusing on their construction using postfix notation. The lecture also covers evaluation, but the emphasis seems to be more on building the tree structure. Therefore, a suitable title should reflect both the construction aspect and the use of postfix expressions.

I should make sure the title is clear and indicates the main subject without being too long. Maybe something like "Construction of Expression Trees from Postfix Expressions" or "Building Binary Expression Trees Using Postfix Notation." Both capture the essence, but I need to choose the most concise and descriptive one.

I think "Construction of Expression Trees from Postfix Expressions" is a bit wordy. Perhaps "Building Expression Trees from Postfix Expressions" is better. Alternatively, "Expression Tree Construction Using Postfix Notation" might be more precise, highlighting the method used.

Wait, the transcript mentions using a character array for the postfix expression and creating nodes for each operand or operator. The slides also mention that the tree is immutable, meaning changes require a new tree. So, the construction process is a key part.

I think "Expression Tree Construction from Postfix Expressions" is concise and covers both the construction and the source of the expression. It clearly indicates the main subject area without being too lengthy.

Expression Tree Construction from Postfix Expressions

Okay, so I need to create detailed lecture notes for the section on Expression Trees, specifically focusing on their construction from postfix expressions. Let me start by understanding the key components involved.

First, I should define what an Expression Tree is. From the transcript and slides, I gather that it's a binary tree where each node represents an operand or an operator. Operands are leaves, and operators are internal nodes. This structure is useful for evaluating expressions.

Next, I need to explain how to construct an Expression Tree using a postfix expression. The slides mention using a stack to facilitate this process. So, I should outline the steps involved in scanning the postfix expression, creating nodes, and using the stack to build the tree.

I should include a detailed algorithm that describes each step, such as creating a node for each symbol, pushing operands onto the stack, and popping nodes when encountering an operator to set as children. It's important to mention that the final node left in the stack is the root of the tree.

I also need to cover the evaluation of the Expression Tree. The transcript talks about a recursive function that evaluates the tree by applying operators to the results of their children. I should explain this process, perhaps with an example, to make it clear how the evaluation works.

Additionally, I should highlight important points, such as the immutability of the tree, meaning any change requires constructing a new tree. This is a key characteristic that distinguishes Expression Trees from other structures.

I should structure the notes with clear headings, bullet points for key concepts, and perhaps include an example with a postfix expression and its corresponding tree. Using diagrams or illustrations could help, but since I'm writing text, I'll describe the example in detail.

I need to ensure that the notes are well-organized, starting with definitions, followed by construction steps, evaluation, and key points. Using bullet points will make the information more digestible for students.

Finally, I should review the notes to make sure they are concise, cover all necessary aspects, and are free of errors. This will help students understand the material thoroughly and apply the concepts in their own work.

# Expression Trees: Construction and Evaluation

## 1. Introduction to Expression Trees

An **Expression Tree** is a binary tree structure where each node represents either an operand or an operator. Operands are typically leaf nodes, while operators are internal nodes. This structure is particularly useful for evaluating mathematical expressions and for translating code into an intermediate form for analysis.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Immutable**: Once constructed, the tree cannot be modified. Any change requires the creation of a new tree.
- **Hierarchical Representation**: The tree follows the natural hierarchy of operations, making it intuitive for evaluation.

## 2. Constructing an Expression Tree from Postfix Notation

### 2.1 Overview of Postfix Notation
- **Postfix Notation** (also known as Reverse Polish Notation) is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to define operation order.

### 2.2 Construction Algorithm
The construction of an Expression Tree from a postfix expression involves the following steps:

1. **Scan the Postfix Expression**: Traverse each symbol of the postfix expression from left to right.
2. **Create Nodes**: For each symbol encountered:
   - **Operands**: Create a new node with the symbol as its value and set both left and right pointers to `NULL`. Push the address of this node onto a stack.
   - **Operators**: Create a new node with the operator as its value. Pop the top node from the stack and set it as the right child of the new node. Pop another node from the stack and set it as the left child of the new node. Push the address of this new node back onto the stack.
3. **Finalize the Tree**: After scanning all symbols, the stack will contain only one node, which is the root of the Expression Tree.

### 2.3 Example: Constructing an Expression Tree for "abc*+"

1. **Postfix Expression**: `abc*+`
2. **Nodes Creation**:
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are operands, so create leaf nodes and push them onto the stack.
   - `*` is an operator. Pop `b` and `c` from the stack, set `c` as the right child and `b` as the left child of `*`. Push `*` back onto the stack.
   - `+` is an operator. Pop `a` and `*` from the stack, set `*` as the right child and `a` as the left child of `+`. Push `+` back onto the stack.
3. **Result**: The root of the tree is `+`, with `a` as the left child and `*` as the right child. The `*` node has `b` and `c` as its children.

### 2.4 Stack Operations Summary
- **Push**: Used to store operand nodes.
- **Pop**: Used to retrieve nodes when an operator is encountered.
- **Peek**: Not explicitly used but necessary to check the top element during pops.

## 3. Evaluating an Expression Tree

### 3.1 Recursive Evaluation Algorithm
The evaluation of an Expression Tree is typically performed using a recursive approach:

1. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (operand), return its value.
2. **Recursive Case**: If the current node is an operator, recursively evaluate the left and right subtrees.
3. **Apply Operator**: Apply the operator to the results from the left and right evaluations.

### 3.2 Example: Evaluating the Tree for "abc*+"

1. **Evaluate Left Subtree (`a`)**: Returns the value of `a`.
2. **Evaluate Right Subtree (`*`)**:
   - Evaluate `b` and `c`, then apply `*` to their values.
3. **Apply `+`**: Add the result of `a` and `b*c`.

### 3.3 Pseudocode for Evaluation
```plaintext
function evaluate(node):
    if node is null:
        return 0
    if node is a leaf:
        return node.value
    leftVal = evaluate(node.left)
    rightVal = evaluate(node.right)
    switch(node.operator):
        case '+':
            return leftVal + rightVal
        case '-':
            return leftVal - rightVal
        case '*':
            return leftVal * rightVal
        case '/':
            return leftVal / rightVal
```

## 4. Key Points

- **Postfix Construction**: Utilizes a stack to manage nodes, ensuring correct parent-child relationships.
- **Immutability**: Ensures data integrity; modifications require a new tree.
- **Efficiency**: Both construction and evaluation are efficient, with time complexities linear to the number of nodes.
- **Applications**: Widely used in compilers, calculators, and parsing mathematical expressions.

## 5. Summary

Expression Trees offer a structured way to represent and evaluate mathematical expressions, particularly when using postfix notation. The construction process, facilitated by a stack, ensures that each operator correctly links its operands. Evaluation, typically recursive, leverages the hierarchical structure to apply operations in the correct order. Understanding Expression Trees is fundamental for various applications in computer science, especially in parsing and evaluating expressions efficiently.

### 1. Introduction to Expression Trees

Okay, so I'm trying to create lecture notes on "Expression Trees" based on the provided transcript and slides. The user has already given a sample section, and now I need to write the content for "1. Introduction to Expression Trees."

First, I should start by understanding what an expression tree is. From the transcript and slides, it seems an expression tree is a data structure used to represent mathematical expressions. It's built using nodes, where each node can be an operand or an operator.

The slides mention that expression trees are immutable, meaning once created, they can't be modified. So, any change requires constructing a new tree. That's an important point to include.

Looking at the construction process, the slides explain that a postfix expression is used to build the tree. Each operand becomes a leaf node, and each operator becomes an internal node with two children. The process uses a stack to manage the nodes as they're created.

I should outline the construction steps clearly. The steps involve scanning each symbol of the postfix expression, creating nodes, and using the stack to handle operators by popping the necessary operands and linking them as children.

The example provided in the slides uses the postfix expression "abc*+". I need to explain how each symbol is processed: 'a', 'b', 'c' become leaf nodes, '*' becomes a parent of 'b' and 'c', and '+' becomes the root with '*' and 'a' as children.

Including an algorithmic representation would be helpful. The slides detail the steps, so I can structure this as a bulleted list for clarity.

I should also mention that expression trees are useful for evaluating expressions and analyzing their structure, which ties into their application in parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions in computer science.

Finally, I need to ensure the notes are well-structured with clear definitions, bullet points for key concepts, and any relevant examples or algorithms. The language should be academic but accessible, avoiding overly technical jargon where possible.

Putting it all together, the section should start with a definition of expression trees, their immutability, the construction process using postfix notation, the role of the stack, and an example to illustrate the process. Including the algorithm steps and the example will make the notes comprehensive and easy to follow.

### 1. Introduction to Expression Trees

**Definition of Expression Trees:**
An expression tree is a data structure used to represent mathematical expressions. It consists of nodes where each node can be an operand or an operator. Operands are typically leaf nodes, while operators are internal nodes with two children, representing the left and right operands.

**Immutability:**
Expression trees are immutable, meaning once constructed, they cannot be modified. Any change to the expression requires the creation of a new tree.

**Construction Using Postfix Notation:**
Expression trees are commonly constructed from postfix expressions (Reverse Polish Notation). The process involves:
- Scanning each symbol of the postfix expression.
- Creating a node for each symbol.
- Using a stack to manage nodes, pushing operands onto the stack.
- For operators, popping the top two nodes from the stack, linking them as children, and pushing the resulting node back onto the stack.

**Algorithm for Construction:**
1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Scan each symbol in the postfix expression from left to right.
3. For each symbol:
   - If it is an operand, create a node and push its address onto the stack.
   - If it is an operator, create a node, pop the top of the stack as the right child, pop again as the left child, set these as children of the new node, and push the new node onto the stack.
4. After processing all symbols, the stack will contain the root node of the expression tree.

**Example:**
Consider the postfix expression "abc*+":
- Process 'a', 'b', 'c' to create leaf nodes.
- Process '*' to create a parent node with 'b' and 'c' as children.
- Process '+' to create the root node with the '*' node and 'a' as children.

**Applications:**
Expression trees are valuable for evaluating expressions and analyzing their structure, making them essential in parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions in computer science.

This structured approach provides a clear understanding of expression trees, their construction, and their applications.

### 2. Constructing Expression Trees from Postfix Notation

Okay, I need to create detailed lecture notes for the section "Constructing Expression Trees from Postfix Notation." Let me start by understanding the content provided.

From the transcript, the speaker explains how to build an expression tree using a postfix expression. They mention scanning each symbol, creating nodes, and using a stack to manage the nodes. For operands, nodes are pushed onto the stack, and for operators, the top two nodes are popped, set as children, and the new node is pushed back. The final node left in the stack is the root of the expression tree.

The slides provide a step-by-step process for constructing the tree. They include an example with the postfix expression "abc*+" and illustrate how each symbol is processed, creating nodes and using a stack to build the tree. The example shows the addresses of nodes and how operators connect operands.

I should structure the notes to include definitions, key points, the algorithm, and examples. I'll start with a definition of expression trees and why postfix notation is used. Then, outline the construction process with bullet points, followed by the algorithm and an example.

I need to ensure that the notes are clear and academic, using bullet points for lists and including any formulas or examples mentioned. I'll avoid markdown and keep the language straightforward.

Let me organize the content:

1. **Introduction**: Define expression trees and their purpose.
2. **Postfix Notation**: Explain why postfix is used for construction.
3. **Construction Process**: Step-by-step explanation using bullet points.
4. **Algorithm**: Present the algorithm in a structured format.
5. **Example**: Walk through the example provided in the slides.

I should make sure each section flows logically, and the example clearly illustrates the process. I'll also highlight important points to emphasize key concepts.

### Constructing Expression Trees from Postfix Notation

#### 1. Introduction to Expression Trees
- **Definition**: An expression tree is a binary tree used to represent mathematical expressions. Each node represents either an operand or an operator.
- **Purpose**: These trees are used for efficiently evaluating expressions and can be particularly useful in parsing and evaluating postfix (Reverse Polish) notation.

#### 2. Postfix Notation in Expression Trees
- **Postfix Notation**: An operator follows its operands. This eliminates the need for parentheses to define operation order.
- **Advantage in Construction**: Postfix notation simplifies the construction of expression trees as it processes each token in a single pass without needing to backtrack.

#### 3. Construction Process
- **Step-by-Step Construction**:
  1. **Scan Symbols**: Traverse the postfix expression from left to right.
  2. **Create Nodes**: For each symbol, create a new node with the symbol as its information.
  3. **Operands**: If the symbol is an operand, push the node's address onto the stack.
  4. **Operators**: If the symbol is an operator, pop the top two nodes from the stack, set the first popped as the right child and the second as the left child, then push the new node back onto the stack.
  5. **Final Root**: After processing all symbols, the remaining node in the stack is the root of the expression tree.

#### 4. Algorithm for Construction
```
Initialize an empty stack.
For each symbol in the postfix expression:
    Create a new node with the symbol as info.
    If the symbol is an operand:
        Push the node's address onto the stack.
    Else (symbol is an operator):
        Pop the top address from the stack as right child.
        Pop the next top address from the stack as left child.
        Set these as right and left children of the new node.
        Push the new node's address onto the stack.
The root of the expression tree is the remaining address in the stack.
```

#### 5. Example: Constructing from Postfix Expression "abc*+"
- **Postfix Expression**: "abc*+"
- **Processing**:
  - **a**: Create node A, push address (100) onto stack.
  - **b**: Create node B, push address (150) onto stack.
  - **c**: Create node C, push address (300) onto stack.
  - *****: Pop 300 (C) as right child and 150 (B) as left child. Create node * with children B and C, push address (250) onto stack.
  - **+**: Pop 250 (*) as right child and 100 (A) as left child. Create node + with children A and *, push address (400) onto stack.
- **Result**: The root is at address 400, representing the expression (a + (b * c)).

This structured approach ensures that each step of the construction process is clear and logically follows from the previous, providing a solid foundation for understanding expression tree construction from postfix notation.

### 3. Structure of Nodes and Tree

Okay, so I need to write detailed lecture notes for the section "3. Structure of Nodes and Tree" based on the provided transcript and slides. Let me start by understanding the content.

First, from the transcript, the speaker explains how each symbol in a postfix expression is processed to build an expression tree. They mention creating nodes for each operand and using a stack to handle operators. Each node has a character as its information field and pointers to left and right children. The process involves pushing operands onto the stack and popping them when an operator is encountered to form the tree structure.

Looking at the slides, they provide a step-by-step explanation of constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression. It starts by scanning each symbol, creating nodes, and using a stack to manage the nodes. The slides also give an example with the postfix expression "abc*+", showing how each symbol is processed and how the tree is built.

I need to structure the notes clearly. I should define key concepts like nodes and the tree structure, outline the construction process with bullet points, and include the example provided. I should also mention the use of recursion in evaluating the tree, as the transcript discusses how each operator node calls the evaluation of its left and right children.

I should ensure that the notes are well-organized, using bullet points for lists and clearly explaining each step. I should also include the example from the slides to illustrate the construction process. Additionally, I need to highlight that the tree is immutable, meaning any change requires a new tree.

Let me make sure I cover all the points without being too verbose. I'll start with definitions, then the construction process, the example, and finally the evaluation using recursion. I'll also include the algorithm steps as bullet points for clarity.

I should also make sure to mention the use of the stack in the construction process, as it's a crucial part of building the tree from a postfix expression. Each operand becomes a leaf node, and each operator becomes an internal node with its children being the results of the operands.

Finally, I'll conclude by summarizing the key points to reinforce understanding.

### 3. Structure of Nodes and Tree

#### 3.1 Definitions of Key Concepts

- **Node**: Each node in an expression tree contains:
  - **Information Field**: Stores a character, which can be an operand or an operator.
  - **Pointers**: Two pointers for left and right children, which can be `NULL` if there are no children.

- **Expression Tree**: A binary tree where each node represents an operand or an operator. Operand nodes are leaves, and operator nodes have their left and right children as operands or other operator nodes.

- **Immutable Tree**: Once constructed, the tree cannot be modified. Any change requires constructing a new tree.

#### 3.2 Construction Process

The construction of an expression tree from a postfix expression involves the following steps:

1. **Scan Symbols**: Process each symbol of the postfix expression from left to right.
2. **Create Nodes**: For each symbol, create a new node with the symbol as its information field and set both children to `NULL`.
3. **Use Stack**: Utilize a stack to manage nodes:
   - **Operands**: Push the address of the node onto the stack.
   - **Operators**: Pop the top two addresses from the stack, assign the first popped as the right child and the second as the left child of the new node, then push the new node's address onto the stack.
4. **Final Tree**: After processing all symbols, the stack contains the root node's address, completing the tree.

#### 3.3 Example: Postfix Expression "abc*+"

1. **Symbols**: `a`, `b`, `c`, `*`, `+`.
2. **Processing**:
   - `a`, `b`, `c`: Create nodes and push onto stack.
   - `*`: Pop `b` and `c`, create a node with `*` as root, `b` as left, `c` as right. Push this node.
   - `+`: Pop the `*` node and `a`, create a node with `+` as root, `a` as left, `*` as right. Push this node.
3. **Result**: The final tree has `+` as the root, `a` as the left child, and `*` as the right child, which in turn has `b` and `c` as children.

#### 3.4 Evaluation Using Recursion

The evaluation of the expression tree is performed recursively:

1. **Base Case**: If a node is a leaf (operand), return its value.
2. **Recursive Case**: For an operator node, recursively evaluate the left and right children, then apply the operator to the results.

Example evaluation of the tree rooted at `+`:
- Evaluate left child `a`, return value.
- Evaluate right child `*`, which involves evaluating `b` and `c`, then multiplying.
- Apply `+` to the results of `a` and `b*c`.

#### 3.5 Key Points

- **Stack Usage**: Essential for constructing the tree from postfix notation.
- **Node Structure**: Each node has an info field and pointers for children.
- **Immutable Nature**: Ensures data integrity by requiring a new tree for modifications.

This structured approach ensures clarity and efficiency in both constructing and evaluating expression trees, leveraging postfix notation and stack operations effectively.

### 4. Role of Stack in Construction

Okay, I need to create detailed lecture notes for the section titled "4. Role of Stack in Construction" based on the provided transcript and slides. Let me start by understanding the content.

From the transcript, the speaker explains how a stack is used in constructing an expression tree from a postfix expression. They mention that each symbol in the postfix expression is processed: if it's an operand, a node is created and pushed onto the stack. If it's an operator, two nodes are popped from the stack to become the right and left children of a new node, which is then pushed back onto the stack. This process continues until all symbols are processed, leaving the root node's address in the stack.

Looking at the slides, they provide a step-by-step explanation of the construction process. Slide 4 mentions that a postfix expression is used to construct the expression tree, with operands becoming leaf nodes and operators connecting two nodes. Slide 5 gives an example with the postfix expression "abc*+", showing how each symbol is processed and nodes are created and pushed/popped from the stack. Slide 6 details the algorithm: scanning the postfix expression, creating nodes, and using the stack to manage node addresses.

I should structure the notes to include key concepts, important points as bullet points, and any algorithms or examples. The notes should be clear and academic, using bullet points for lists.

First, I'll define the key concepts: Stack, Postfix Expression, and Expression Tree. Then, outline the role of the stack in the construction process using bullet points. I'll include the algorithm as a step-by-step process and provide an example similar to the one in the slides. Finally, I'll summarize the importance of the stack in this context.

I need to ensure that each section is concise and informative, using academic language without being too verbose. I'll avoid markdown and keep the formatting simple with clear headings and bullet points.

Let me organize the content:

1. **Key Concepts**: Define Stack, Postfix Expression, and Expression Tree.
2. **Role of the Stack**: Explain how the stack is used in the construction process with bullet points.
3. **Algorithm**: Present the step-by-step process as outlined in the slides.
4. **Example**: Use the provided example to illustrate the process.
5. **Summary**: Highlight the importance of the stack.

I should make sure each section flows logically and covers all necessary points without redundancy. Now, I'll draft the content accordingly.

### 4. Role of Stack in Construction

#### Key Concepts:
- **Stack**: A linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, allowing elements to be pushed onto and popped from the top.
- **Postfix Expression**: A mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands, eliminating the need for parentheses.
- **Expression Tree**: A binary tree where each node represents an operator or operand, used to evaluate expressions.

#### Role of the Stack:
- **Temporary Storage**: The stack serves as an intermediary to store addresses of nodes during tree construction.
- **Operand Handling**: When an operand is encountered, a node is created, and its address is pushed onto the stack.
- **Operator Handling**: When an operator is encountered, the top two addresses are popped from the stack, assigned as right and left children of a new node, and the new node's address is pushed back onto the stack.

#### Algorithm:
1. **Scan the Postfix Expression**: Process each symbol from left to right.
2. **Create Nodes**: For each symbol, create a node with the symbol as its information.
3. **Push Operands**: If the symbol is an operand, push the node's address onto the stack.
4. **Process Operators**: If the symbol is an operator, pop the top two addresses from the stack, assign them as right and left children of the new node, then push the new node's address onto the stack.
5. **Complete Construction**: After processing all symbols, the stack will contain the root node's address.

#### Example:
- **Postfix Expression**: "abc*+"
  1. Process 'a': Create node A, push address 100 onto the stack.
  2. Process 'b': Create node B, push address 150 onto the stack.
  3. Process 'c': Create node C, push address 300 onto the stack.
  4. Process '*': Pop addresses 150 and 300, create node * with B and C as children, push address 250 onto the stack.
  5. Process '+': Pop addresses 100 and 250, create node + with A and * as children, push address 400 onto the stack.
  6. Stack now contains the root address 400.

#### Summary:
The stack is crucial in constructing expression trees from postfix expressions by managing node addresses efficiently, ensuring correct tree formation through its LIFO operations. This method systematically builds the tree, leveraging the stack's capabilities for temporary storage and node linkage.

### 5. Evaluation of Expression Trees

Okay, I need to create detailed lecture notes for the section "5. Evaluation of Expression Trees" based on the provided transcript and slides. Let me start by understanding the content.

First, the transcript explains how an expression tree is evaluated. It mentions using a postfix expression to build the tree and then evaluating it by recursively processing each node. The example given involves evaluating a tree with operations like addition and multiplication.

The slides provide a step-by-step process for constructing the expression tree using a stack. They also include an example with the postfix expression "abc*+", which is converted into an expression tree with nodes for each operand and operator.

So, for the evaluation section, I should cover how the tree is evaluated once it's constructed. The key points from the transcript include:

- Recursive evaluation of left and right subtrees.
- Applying the operator at the current node to the results of its children.
- Returning the computed value back up the recursion.

I should structure the notes with clear definitions, key points as bullet points, and include the algorithm and example provided.

I need to ensure that the evaluation process is explained thoroughly, perhaps with an example to illustrate how each node is processed. Also, mentioning that the tree is immutable and changes require a new tree is important.

Let me organize the notes:

1. Start with an overview of evaluation.
2. Define key terms like recursive evaluation and operator application.
3. Outline the algorithm steps in bullet points.
4. Provide an example to demonstrate the process.
5. Highlight important points about the evaluation process.

I should make sure the language is clear and academic, using bullet points for lists and ensuring that each section flows logically into the next. I'll avoid markdown and keep it in plain text as per the instructions.

### 5. Evaluation of Expression Trees

#### 5.1 Overview of Evaluation
The evaluation of an expression tree involves computing the result of the mathematical expression it represents. This process is typically performed recursively, where each node's value is determined by its children's values.

#### 5.2 Key Concepts
- **Recursive Evaluation**: The process of evaluating each node by first evaluating its left and right subtrees.
- **Operator Application**: Once the values of the left and right children are known, the operator at the current node is applied to these values.

#### 5.3 Algorithm for Evaluation
1. **Base Case**: If the current node is a leaf (an operand), return its value.
2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Evaluate the left subtree and obtain its value.
   - Evaluate the right subtree and obtain its value.
   - Apply the operator at the current node to the values from the left and right subtrees.
3. **Return the Result**: The result of the operation is returned to the parent node.

#### 5.4 Example: Evaluating an Expression Tree
Consider the expression tree for the postfix expression "abc*+":

```
    +
   / \
  *   b
 / \
a   c
```

1. **Evaluate Left Subtree**:
   - Node * (operator) requires evaluating its children.
   - Evaluate left child 'a' (operand), value = a.
   - Evaluate right child 'c' (operand), value = c.
   - Apply operator *, result = a * c.

2. **Evaluate Right Subtree**:
   - Node 'b' (operand), value = b.

3. **Apply Operator at Root**:
   - Apply operator + to the results from left and right subtrees.
   - Result = (a * c) + b.

#### 5.5 Important Points
- **Immutable Nature**: The expression tree is immutable; any change requires constructing a new tree.
- **Efficiency**: Recursive evaluation is straightforward but may lead to stack overflow for very deep trees.
- **Postfix Construction**: The tree is typically built from a postfix expression using a stack, ensuring correct structure for evaluation.

This structured approach ensures that each part of the expression is evaluated correctly, leveraging recursion to handle the hierarchical nature of the tree.
