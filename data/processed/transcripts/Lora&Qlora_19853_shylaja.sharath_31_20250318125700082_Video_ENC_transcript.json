  "transcript_text": " he was getting going up to the last round and in HR is getting rejected. So seriously  I saw that there is a behavioral issue, very low confidence and the more you get rejected  now you will go with that fear only. So somebody needs to tweak little bit then that confidence   One of my higher students, way back in 2012, I think, 2015.  very good student he did project under me and used to teach others in the group  four member team damn good I would say in technology aptitude everything all the  rest of the three got placed and he didn't so and single parent only mother is there  so there is daily fight in the home about he not getting placed so the pressure is building  and building and building and after one point he stopped attending interviews he stopped  So, there is regular fights between the mother and the son.  So, then one day he came and told me all these stories.  I was heading ISD department at that time.  So, he came and told me that this is what has happened.  Then I told that I think your mother requires counseling first because there is so much  pressure build the son is not able to attend interviews only.  So, I told him to get the mother first.  Mother used to in the night she used to take head bath and go to God's place and pray.   Thank you.  and this he has seen and he is getting shivers actually looking at his mother's situation  and his single parent and from childhood without father he has come up how much confidence he will have  already there is no confidence and on top of that mother is doing all that in the night  and there is like physical fight between the mother and the son   So I had to little bit intervene there and then did lot of...  to mother first and then one day I dropped him, one day I told him that the next one,  next year one, I told him that he has to take up and I took a promise from him that he will  attend at least.  Aptitude also he stopped attending.  So I took a promise and then he used to respect me because I was his guide.  So then he has a paper also with me and all of that.  Then he said he will do it and then he came and I told him that before going to the interview   to the interview you should come to my room and go.  He came to my room. Instead of going to placement, he went home.  He didn't go. Then I asked him about what happened.  Then he said he got scared and he left. He only showed his face in my room and left.  So the next one I said, you come again, I said. Then the second one, one more.  He came. Then next time he dropped in till the lab thinking that he will again deviate.   I told him that I am going to stay there only outside. He has to finish the test and come.  that job he got. This much intervention was required for that boy. Finally now he is doing  very well. Another guy by name Himanshu, he was also Adobe he got it finally. So little  bit of counseling I do during that time when they are distressed. That is one of my job  ones. So it's only just pep talk is required nothing else. I don't do anything great but  to boost the confidence, we need to step in, 5 minutes, that is what is mentorship actually.  So we should step in and night 12 o'clock he called me stating that he got adobe.  Yeah, yeah, he is still in touch with me. So he makes it a point that he wishes me on my birthday.  So all of that, so that is happening like that. So lots of lives we touch like that, nice.   That's a very...  pressure cooker kind of scenario. My friend is getting players, I am not getting players.  Manisha and Ayush they were in single team. They come for pre-placement talk also,  bootstrap also they did. Ayush got it in first place, Citrix. And Manisha got it in the 52nd attempt,  52nd company. So I asked Ayush about sweets. Then he said until she doesn't get it, I won't.   So 50 seconds.  one she got it and after that she got three jobs I went to her marriage also now she has  a child all of that is like family connect Aish also had invited me to north Gujarat  he is from Surat so he had invited me for his marriage he is in regular touch we plan  to do a joint collaboration also that extent of friendship is there now because of that   Yeah, they'll like become friends now 2014 graduated  But he had promised me at that time that he would come back and serve the institution.  14 to 24, he has been coming. One decade he has come back. He has kept the promise.  He was the best outgoing student of that batch, 2014.  Even now I wrote to several alumni to assist in my capstone teams.  They all have come back and agreed. The only thing is the teams are not showing interest.   So lot of volume may have ready.  Okay lot of digression I think I will get back to the yeah.  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm   Thank you.  Thank you.  This is the formula used for quantization and decontization and lower updates.  So I will give you a problem now you have to solve.   you solve this you will actually understand again better.  Pardon?  Yes.  Pardon?  Yes.  Pardon?  Yes.  Pardon?  Yes.  Pardon?  Yes.  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?  Pardon?   Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm going to go back to the other side.  I am sorry.  Pardon?  I am sorry.  Yeah.   Thank you.  There are two problems, one for quantization and decontization, you have to find the error  in quantization. This is the second problem for Lora, wait, there are two problems, they   separate. Solve it.  What is x minimum from the given set? Minus 2.0. What is the x max? 0.2 and b is 4 bits.   I'm giving you four.  The  Instead of a matrix I just gave only few values, one row I have given.   Thank you.  See all of you please proceed to solve the problem.  Later on you can continue your other discussions, cast on reviews all of that you can do it  later.  Thursday there will be a lab experimentation on LORA.   Thank you.  on lower of fine-tuning Thursday lab, one lab and after that mostly hackathon, I will   I will announce the hackathon one more two more. I will announce.  The sooner it is better because load is getting increased rest of the projects you have to  do it. If I finish off quickly it is better for you.   Solve all the problem why you are looking at it.  So, your friend nicely at the right time he went out stating that he wants a notebook.   X is for all the values you have to quantize.  So, quantization of every value is x minus 1.8 is x, x minimum is minus 2.0 divided  by delta and rounded.  Sir, which is 5 values?  5 values that is quantization not the way I wrote the table that is for toy example,  this is the real quantization.   Now this is the formula that is the toy example which I showed.  this is how you have to do it using the formula you have to quantize.  Formal.  Round it round I have written.  Directly.  See the quantization example I gave is just for example the quantization is done like  this using formula.  Pardon.  The formula is given now.   of the quantity issue.  you record delta and xmin that will be. Round is like mathematics rounding point 5 and above  is above point 5 below is below number. It is a round function mathematics round function   13.5 is 14, 13.4 is 13.  Yes, yes, one delta one x minimum but you will get five quantized values, you have to  quantize every number one delta one x minimum yes, plus from this formula only you will   q x into delta plus x minimally. In the formula only you will get x minimally.  4, I refer to b cos 3. Usually it is given otherwise you can assume.   Thank you.  Thank you.  Please solve the problem later you can look at your laptop.  Capstone review you prepare later.  All that you should do it at home.   is boxers.  The bottle is broken.  I think this is the bottle.   There is a round, there is a round, you know, quantized. The bottle is broken.  we should ask some attendant to clean it up.  You are going to ask the attendant to clean it up.  Call the attendant.  Somebody steps on it.  The cleaners will be around, you call them.   It's all the way...  you are not holding pen also and you are not having book also. I am telling you everything  like this will have an impact in placement. This is showing your thought process of disrespecting  people. It will come up there also. I am telling you this is not a good habit.  You can call it anything that is a quantized W.   on.  quantization you decontize it and find the error the first problem only  Quantization and decontization both you should do  And find the error  This one this is a two mark  And for you especially only one mark because you are not concentrating in my class both of you are only gossiping nothing   Thank you.  All your interest, initial interest one week after that no, you have benched itself only  except for...  delta is 0.1466 and then you round it, you know this number round, this mathematics round,   point five and above, thirteen point five and above is the fourteen, thirteen point, this is round, this is not sealant lower, natural.  Have you experienced it that way?  I am not sure.  That may not be that much.   actually it should be faster that is why we  use this memory of course yes, the quantization depends on number of billion parameters it  may be yes definitely compared to readily available  the quantization little extra over it but it will be in second cycle.   While writing only I should write it properly.  you have to transfer b is now 2 cross 1 1 cross 2 so I should write it as 0.1 and  remove the wires for her to, I want you to find the error in quantization after decontization   you to find the error.  Yes, Arshil, take a sheet and then start writing.   Thank you.  the  one side is a buttery one   He is a very good guy. He is very good.  He knows the gas piece.  Then error you found out find error. No, no error in original you will have after   decontization some value will have no subtract.  Dequantized, original with original, original minus decontest.   Thank you.  The  No, not here, the decontaktization error.   I just said, I just said, you know that.  There is not that one for the other this problem I am saying this is not the error that one  this is not quantized only.  All the Qx values, you will have another 4 decontas values, you have to decontize, you   You are not rounded actually, you are not rounded.  write that all the context values write as 1 r a ok it's ok all the context values as  1 r a and then you have to decontact you will have 4 values then between that original and  decontact values error. Error is subtractive.  Subtraction. So, it can be made it's error.  Error makes. I don't know the I just came.   Bye.  What is the quantization?  1.   The D quantized minus.  You write it is better write on write you also write the error no no no w minus q dash   You write down. Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  You can do it and come music.  Okay.  You took your own sweet time. What's your name? You took your own sweet time to get the notebook.  What for? This will show up in placement. You should have respect for what I am doing.   This is not the way.  Yes, Kintma, do it.  Call the problem.  Last bench if you sit, you will be sleeping.  Now you are sitting in third bench, chatting.  You come to first bench, let us see if there is any improvement.   Thank you.
